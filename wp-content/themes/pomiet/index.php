		      <p>At Pomiet, we apply proven research techniques and scientific discipline to uncover insights and learnings that fuel ultimate creativity. We say, ultimate creativity, because our solutions are not just about attractive aesthetics or artful applications. Our solutions are about addressing those obstacles that ultimately limit, or block, your success - the ones that most companies donâ€™t even realize are there.</p>
          <p>Every product or service people interact with has been designed. Some of these artifacts have been designed well, yet very little thought may have gone into others. Regardless of whether an artifact is consciously engineered, it inherently has a design. We employ research techniques and scientific discipline to uncover the aspects of a product that are most important to people, and use these findings to guide our designs.</p>

              <h2>Research</h2>
              <p>Any systematic investigation begins with a question, and this question guides the researcher throughout the investigation. As one question is answered, the research is led to many other questions. At Pomiet, our first question always has to do with how people interact with a system or process. This question has led to other questions in fields as diverse as image processing and online store usage patterns.</p>

              <h2>Scientific Discipline</h2>
              <p>In the day-to-day working through a problem, many questions can be posed and rabbit trails chased. Without a disciplined approach to inquiry researchers and designers can spend a lot of time on tasks that do not produce results. At Pomiet we apply the discipline of Lean Project Management to our inquiry. By understanding what a person or system is supposed to do, and breaking the investigation into manageable tasks, we bring focus and measurable progress to an otherwise chaotic process that often leaves participants feeling confused and frustrated.</p>

          At Pomiet, we like to have large drop quotes in the right sidebar of content pages on our website.  Because that's how we roll.
